// Classes give us a new syntax in order to create constructor functions
// we use the class keyword to create classes
// by convention, the name of the class starts with an upper case letter


class Car {

}
let car = new Car();
console.log(car);
// result: Car {}, our new object
// in order to instantiate an object of this class, we use the new keyword, just as in a constructor function
