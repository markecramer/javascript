// Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

// Cross-site scripting is when javascript is coming from a 3rd party server, such as loading a library

// CSP: Content Security Policy - Use a header called Content-Security-Policy
// CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing - Access-Control-Allow-Origin

// These are HTTP headers, not JavaScript features and are setup on the server side
