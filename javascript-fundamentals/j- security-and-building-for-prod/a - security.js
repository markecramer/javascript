// Application Data Security:

// Don't store passwords, secrets or other sensitive information
// Don't use global variables: very easy to look at and manipulate
// Assume hackers can read all your JS code and access all data sent to a browser
// If you want to make things a little more difficult, you can use a JS Obfuscator
